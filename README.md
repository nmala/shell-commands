# shell-commands

A growing repository of custom shell functions and aliases I wrote to assist with my dev projects.

I use zsh as my default shell, and a copy of the custom_shell_commands.sh file is placed in ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom and renamed with a .zsh file extension to be compatible. This allows all of the commands to be loaded upon terminal launch.

I initially researched this because I was curious how to abstract commonly mundane terminal commands. It was an eye-opening experience, so I wrote a [Medium article](https://blog.usejournal.com/an-intro-to-custom-terminal-aliases-and-functions-32696e8d273c) on what I learned to share the knowledge with others. There are some great resources listed towards the end that I highly recommend checking out.
