# shell-commands

A growing repository of custom shell functions and aliases I think of and use in terminal to help with my dev projects.

I initially researched this because I was curious how to abstract commonly mundane terminal commands. It was an eye-opening experience, so I wrote a [Medium article](https://blog.usejournal.com/an-intro-to-custom-terminal-aliases-and-functions-32696e8d273c) on what I learned to share the knowledge with others. There are some great resources listed towards the end that I highly recommend checking out.
